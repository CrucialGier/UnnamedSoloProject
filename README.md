# Solo Project

Tutorials for Unity with VisualStudio and C#

## Description

This is a small showcase of the techniques I've been learning so far and does not represent what my final product will be.

## Setup

Assuming you are running in windows, clone the repository at https://github.com/CrucialGier/UnnamedSoloProject.git. Then open the exe file included. Choose visual settings (I recomment not too big and windowed) and hit play.

Controls are W A S D or Arrow Keys.

Should Display "You Win" after collecting all gold rock thingies.
